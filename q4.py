#You are a renowned thief who has recently switched from stealing precious
#metals to stealing cakes because of the insane profit margins. You end up
#hitting the jackpot, breaking into the world's largest privately owned 
#stock of cakesâ€”the vault of the Queen of England.

#Each cake type has a weight and a value

#You only have a certain amount of pounds you can carry

#Write an algorithm to take the cake values and weights, and your capacity
#And calculate the most profitable combination of cakes for your capacity
#Cake 1 weighs 7 and is valued at 160
#Cake 2 weights 3 and is valued 90
#Cake 3 weighs 2 and is valued 15
cake_tuples = [(7,160),(3,90),(2,15)]
#Your bag can carry
capacity = 20
